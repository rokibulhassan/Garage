  As a user
  I want to update picture description and date

  Background: A gallery picture exists
    Given a user "john" exists with username: "johndoe"
    And an approved vehicle "vw golf" exists with user: user "john"
    And a gallery "das auto" exists with vehicle: approved vehicle "vw golf"
    And a picture exists with title: "old and boring", gallery: gallery "das auto"

    And I login as the user "john"
    And I go to the approved vehicle "vw golf"'s my profile
    And I click on "Galleries"
    And I go to the gallery "das auto"'s pictures list

    Then I should see "old and boring" image within the content
    And I should not see "new and exciting" image within the content

  Scenario: Edit picture description
